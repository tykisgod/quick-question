# Changelog

All notable changes to quick-question are documented here.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- Built-in project-local `tykit_mcp` bridge with `unity_*` MCP tools and capability metadata
- `./scripts/qq-doctor.sh` to inspect direct-path vs MCP routing in consumer Unity projects
- Agent integration and consumer rollout docs for validating the published install path

### Changed
- `install.sh` now copies the built-in bridge into the consumer project, wires `.mcp.json`, and pins `tykit` to the tested published revision
- qq now prefers the built-in `tykit_mcp` bridge before third-party Unity MCP backends when MCP is available
- README installation docs now describe the default built-in bridge flow for consumer projects

### Fixed
- Unity test runs now stop Play Mode first and prevent overlapping test executions
- Missing Unity meta files for the mirrored `tykit` package are restored
- `qq-doctor.sh` is shipped as an executable script

### Fixed
- `install.sh` now copies `scripts/hooks/` subdirectory
- `install.sh` output uses current skill names (`/qq:test`, `/qq:commit-push`)
- Duplicate scripts in tykit `Scripts~/` replaced with symlinks
- Review Gate documentation accuracy (`.cs` and `Docs/*.md`, not "all edits")
- Git added to Prerequisites (hard dependency)
